## Features

- Upload a text file to generate new text based on its content.
- Specify the context size (k) for the Markov Chain.
- Choose the number of words to generate.
- Option to remove punctuation and convert text to lowercase.
- Visualize word frequency with a bar chart.
- Generate text dynamically or all at once.
- Download the generated text as a `.txt` file.
